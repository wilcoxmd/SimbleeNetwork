# SimbleeNetwork
Additional network topology definitions and control for Simblee devices

## Info
This is a library to add to any Simblee project where you need more than just point to point communication.

SimbleeNetwork attempts to provide a networking library based on the SimbleeCOM library. SimbleeCOM provides a reliable method for point to point communication between two simblees, but as of yet nonetwork topology has been defined. 

The SimbleNetwork library attempts to provide a small star network structure as well as functions for sending to specific nodes or a group of nodes.
